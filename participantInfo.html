<h2>
  What will the study consist of?
</h2>

<p>
  There will be a consent form (as required by the University ethics process), and then a short multiple-choice form in which some background questions around your use of accessible technologies will be assessed.

  Then you will be required to look at a webpage containing some newly-developed accessible graph elements. There is no format with how this should be browsed, the only requirement is to have seen all 3 graphs.

  After this, there will be a second short form, in which some questions will be asked about the demo.
