# Limitations

- Can't use for massive data, will become long to read and skip over
- Readable doesn't mean accessible

- Using <figure> is good as it's a sectioning root - it's children don't contribute to the outline of its ancestor

- Trying to use some new SVG attributes (such as tabindex) but lots of SVG2 is not yet implemented, even in accessibility-forward browsers like Firefox (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/SVG_2_support_in_Mozilla)
