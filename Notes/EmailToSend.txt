Hi all,

My name is Aleena Baig and I am currently studying at the University of Bristol. I am doing a project on web accessibility and I am looking for a few volunteers to test a small demo and survey over the next couple of weeks (this would take around 15/20 mins)

I am looking for screen-reader users of all levels and ages


P.S. Apologies if get this email multiple times, as I am trying to cover all mailing lists!
