Seeking volunteers for a university study

Hi all,

I am doing a university project on web accessibility and I am looking for a few volunteers to test a small demo and survey over the next couple of weeks (this would take around 15/20 mins)

I am looking for screen-reader users of all levels and ages

If you are interested please let me know at ab15748@bristol.ac.uk and I will send over details, I'm keen to get a couple of real-world users for this!

P.S. Apologies if get this email multiple times, as I am trying to cover several mailing lists!
