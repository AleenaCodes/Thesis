SVG

aria-labelledby for title
aria-describedby for description - but not on all platforms, can double-up on labelledby instead (but not ideal!)

Something with aria role figure?




==== Features ====

Skip over graph description
Think of basic descripton "upward trend" etc.
Hover mouse to show info+read out info?

=== Library implementation notes ===

Specify type of graph, dataset, id of div to put it in, units (so that natural language "highest price" can be made)
  Might need to think carefully about this

== Other Notes ==

In thesis, provide table showing WCAG guidelines are met? Will probs be long so for the appendix
