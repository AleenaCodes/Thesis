SVG


Something with aria role figure?




==== Features ====

Skip over graph description
Think of basic description "upward trend" etc.
Hover mouse to show info+read out info?
Does this need "focusable:false"? See accessible SVG icons article

=== Dev Implementation Notes

Use SVG title and desc
Used aria-role="figure"
aria-labelledby for title
aria-describedby for description - but not on all platforms, can double-up on labelledby instead (but not ideal!)

=== Library implementation notes ===

- Specify type of graph, dataset, id of div to put it in, units (so that natural language "highest price" can be made)
  - Might need to think carefully about this
- Check num of characters in labels - define left column width by this on bar graph
- Use brewer palettes for colours, find accessible patterns

== Other Notes ==

In thesis, provide table showing WCAG guidelines are met? Will probs be long so for the appendix

"Inlining the SVG provides more predictable results and control than if it is added with <use> or <img> because the SVG source is directly available in the DOM which is exposed to the accessibility API that is used by AT." - from https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svgs/
