Hi <NAME>,

Thank you very much for your email. Please find the information sheet for the study at the following link (a few minutes read): https://aleenacodes.github.io/Thesis/participantInfo.html

The survey can be found at the following link: https://forms.gle/idQgWjM5f4NqxnFNA

I am using Google Forms for the survey, but if you run into issues with this, please let me know and I can supply questions in alternate format.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions!

Many thanks,
Aleena



I am looking for desktop testing as opposed to mobile so if you would be able to do this on a PC that would be great!

If it is possible, please complete this within the next 2 weeks
